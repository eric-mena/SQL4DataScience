WORKING WITH TEXT STRINGS
  CONCATENATION
    *Concatenation is accomplished in SQL by using the pipe [or sometimes called the vertical bar key (|)].
    *Syntax:
      SELECT CompanyName, ContactName, CompanyName || '('|| ContactName ||')'
      FROM customers
    *CONCAT can also be used, but this function only works with a maximum of 2 inputs at a time, and to
      achieve 3 or more concatenated inputs would require a series of nested CONCAT functions.
  TRIMMING STRINGS
    *Functions: TRIM, RTRIM, LTRIM
    *Syntax:
      SELECT TRIM("    You the best.      ") AS TrimmedString
  SUBSTRING
    *Syntax:
      SUBSTR(StringName, StringPpoition, numberOfCharactersToBeReturned);
    *If the number of characters to be returned exceeds the number of characters in the string,
      SQLite will return the number of characters in the string.
  UPPER AND LOWER CASE
    *All 3 of these functions will change the entire string to upper/lower case
    *UPPER and UCASE both do the same thing.
    *Syntax:
      SELECT UPPER(column_name)
      FROM table_name;
    *Syntax:
      SELECT LOWER(column_name)
      FROM table_name;
    *Syntax:
      SELECT UCASE(column_name)
      FROM table_name;
